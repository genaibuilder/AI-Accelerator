**Prompt Patterns**:

In my work on prompts, I focus on selecting PROMPT PATTERNS that match the prompt's goals to improve AI response effectiveness. These patterns, designed to align with human thinking and problem-solving.

# Comprehensive Guide to Prompt Patterns

Prompt patterns serve as strategic tools in interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. These patterns are crucial for eliciting specific types of responses, programming the AI to align with human reasoning, and solving complex problems. Below is an organized and detailed guide to various prompt patterns.

## 1. **Meta Language Creation Pattern**
This pattern involves designing a custom language or notation system to enhance the LLM's understanding of specialized tasks, making it easier for the AI to comprehend and execute complex instructions.

## 2. **Output Automater Pattern**
Generates scripts or automation tools based on the LLM's output recommendations, aiming to streamline various tasks by automating repetitive actions or responses.

## 3. **Persona Pattern**
Tailors responses by assigning specific personas to the LLM, thereby enriching the quality of interaction. This approach leverages the model's adaptability to assume diverse roles or characters.

### Persona Pattern Usage
- **Action**: Act as Persona X
- **Task**:

 Perform Task Y
Replace "X" with a suitable persona (e.g., speech therapist, nutritionist) and specify the task "Y" that the persona should perform.

#### Examples:
- Act as a speech therapist providing an evaluation for a three-year-old child based on the speech sample "I meed way woy".
- Respond as a computer that has experienced a cyber-attack, replying with what a Linux terminal would output. Request the first command.
- Play the role of the lamb from the nursery rhyme "Mary had a little lamb", describing the lamb's actions based on Mary's activities.

## 4. **Question Refinement Pattern**
Enhances the precision of user queries by suggesting refinements or improvements, thereby leading to more accurate and contextualized responses.

### Question Refinement Process
- After submitting a general question, the model uses its understanding of language and patterns to suggest a more refined question.
- The user can choose whether to use the suggested refined question.

#### Practical Application:
- When asked, "Should I attend Vanderbilt University?" the model suggests a more detailed question considering personal factors and objectives.

## 5. **Cognitive Verifier Pattern**
Breaks down complex problems into smaller, more manageable questions, combining the answers to provide a comprehensive solution. This pattern encourages a deeper understanding and verification of the information provided.

### Cognitive Verifier Pattern Application
- When posed with a question, generate a series of additional questions that could lead to a more accurate answer.
- Combine the answers to these individual questions to formulate a final response.

#### Examples:
- For planning a recipe, ask about available ingredients and kitchen tools, then combine answers to suggest a recipe that can be prepared with the given resources.
- For trip planning, inquire about the budget, preferred activities, and car availability to better plan the itinerary.

## 6. **Audience Persona Pattern**
Adapts LLM output to suit specific audience characteristics, ensuring content relevance and engagement by tailoring the output based on audience knowledge and interests.

### Examples of Audience Persona Application:
- Simplify explanations for computer science novices, making complex models understandable.
- Creatively explain language models to historical figures like Christopher Columbus using metaphors they would comprehend.
- Adapt explanations for children, comparing LLMs to "robot friends" who love reading and word games.

## 7. **Alternative Approaches Pattern**
Presents different methods for executing tasks, encouraging users to consider various approaches and informing them about alternative concepts or strategies.

## 8. **Flipped Interaction Pattern**
Reverses the usual interaction flow, with the LLM initiating questions to guide the conversation towards achieving a specific goal or output.

## 9. **Reflection Pattern**
Allows the LLM to introspect its own output, identifying and addressing any potential errors or inaccuracies, fostering a self-improvement mechanism.

## 10. **Template Pattern**
Users specify a particular output template, which the LLM then populates with content, ensuring that responses adhere to a predefined format.

## 11. **Visualization Generator Pattern**
Facilitates the creation of user-generated visualizations by producing textual outputs that can be fed into AI-based image generators or visualization tools.

## 12. **Recipe Pattern**
Outlines a sequence of steps or actions to achieve a specified outcome, accommodating for partially known information or constraints.

## 13. **Infinite Generation Pattern**
Enables the LLM to generate content indefinitely, without the user needing to re-enter prompts, fostering continuous interaction.

## 14. **Game Play Pattern**
Transforms LLM output into an interactive game format, offering users an engaging play experience through textual or conceptual games.

## 15. **Refusal Breaker Pattern**
Automatically reformulates a user's question in cases where the LLM initially refuses to produce an answer, aiming to navigate around the model's constraints.

## 16. **Context Manager Pattern**
Allows users to specify or adjust the context within which the LLM operates, controlling the scope and relevance of the information it uses to generate responses.
